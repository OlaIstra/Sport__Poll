# Sport__Poll

**About app:**
Sports Poll App lets users vote for some players or draw in different games. Only registered users can vote. Also, they can see all their polls. Everybody can sign up. If user votes in all available tournaments he will see info "No more games available. Please try later!"

**Work description:**
The development took about 10 hours. It is a little bit more than expected because I decided to add a page with user polls, to store user's polls in a database and to show each user its polls.
I decided to not use local storage for polls data so that the user can see his data from different devices at different times.

**Development tools:**
React + React Hooks + Redux. For components, I used Material UI and "styled components", for HTTP request - axios, for testing - enzyme. 

**Instructions**
Please clone repository of project on your computer. Open it in IDE. Run Terminal and do `npm install`, then `npm start`
